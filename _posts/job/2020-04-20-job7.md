Job's suffering. This period of suffering is futile (v3), and he felt there was no hope (v2), only weariness. Pain has caused his sleep, wearisome nights (v4). Our life is short (v7-but a breath), like the clouds vanish and gone, goes down the grave and never return (v9).

Job complained to God about his situation. He will not stay quiet. He wonders why God restrained him like this, like a monster (v12). He couldn't even sleep or rest, disturbed with dreams and visions (v14). He felt so miserable that he rather die (v15).

Job asked if he has sinned. He asked what he had done that sinned against God (v20), that God is causing him suffering. Job thinks God is punishing him, but it is not true. God allowed it, it is a test, and God will raise him up. He asked God to pardon him, forgive him if he had sinned.

- we should always cry out to God, seek God
- we should reflect why we are suffering, is it due to sin, is it God is testing us?
