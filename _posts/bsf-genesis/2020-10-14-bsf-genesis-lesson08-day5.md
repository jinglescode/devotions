# Summary of Genesis 12:10-20

> 10 Now there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the famine was severe. 11 As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, “I know what a beautiful woman you are. 12 When the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they will kill me but will let you live. 13 Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you.”
> 
> 14 When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Sarai was a very beautiful woman. 15 And when Pharaoh’s officials saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into his palace. 16 He treated Abram well for her sake, and Abram acquired sheep and cattle, male and female donkeys, male and female servants, and camels.
> 
> 17 But the Lord inflicted serious diseases on Pharaoh and his household because of Abram’s wife Sarai. 18 So Pharaoh summoned Abram. “What have you done to me?” he said. “Why didn’t you tell me she was your wife? 19 Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go!” 20 Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and everything he had.

Abram was to trust in God to lead him to a place that God will show him along the way. But Abram decided to settle in Egypt and to live there for a while because the famine was severe. Also, out of fear for his own life and possibly getting good treatment from the Egyptians, Abram lied and claimed that Sarai was his sister, not his wife. In the short term, Abram was well taken care of; he was given sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, and servants. During the time of famine, this was a good deal.

God intervened and stopped the wrongdoings by inflicting serious diseases on Pharaoh and his household. The Pharaoh questioned Abram and gave orders and sent him away, with his wife and everything he had.
