# Summary of Genesis 28:1-9

Isaac called Jacob, and he later commanded him not to marry a Canaanite woman. Instead, he was told to go to Paddan, find a wife among Sarah's brothers. Jacob went his way as he was instructed. Esau heard and realized how displeasing the Canaanite women were to his father Isaac, who went to marry Mahalath, in addition to the wives he already had.

# Questions

**3. What differences exist between this blessing from Isaac and the one Jacob received while disguised as his brother, Esau?** 

Genesis 27:

> 28 May God give you heaven's dew    and earth's richness—    an abundance of grain and new wine. May nations serve you    and peoples bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers,    and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed    and those who bless you be blessed."

Genesis 28

> May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and increase your numbers until you become a community of peoples. May he give you and your descendants the blessing given to Abraham, so that you may take possession of the land where you now reside as a foreigner, the land God gave to Abraham."

The blessing from Genesis 28 is very similar to those given to Abraham and Isaac.

**4. Why did Isaac encourage Jacob to flee to Paddan Aram?** To find a wife among the daughters of Laban, Sarah's brothers.

**5. When have you recently had the opportunity to redeem a circumstance or relationship through a deliberate choice to obey God's Word?** 

**6. What did Esau do when he learned Isaac commanded Jacob not to marry a Canaanite woman? What wrong thinking does his choice reveal?** He decided to marry one in addition to the wives he already had. He deliberately disobeys.
