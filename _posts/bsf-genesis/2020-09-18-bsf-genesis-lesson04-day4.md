> Cain said to the Lord, “My punishment is more than I can bear. 14 Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.”
> 15 But the Lord said to him, “Not so; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over.” Then the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him. 16 So Cain went out from the Lord’s presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.

# Summary of Genesis 4:13-16

Cain was driven out of God's presence, and he feels that the punishment is too much, and he worried that others would kill him. We can see that Cain still thinks about himself and does not ask for forgiveness. Nevertheless, we see God's mercy, giving Cain a mark that protected him so that no one would kill him. I think if Cain were to confess, repent, and turn back to God right now, God might accept him. God gave us multiple opportunities to confess and repent; we can turn back to God.

# Questions

**What do you learn about Cain from his responses to the Lord?** Cain was concern about his welfare and his future. He wasn't concern about his sin and his confession. He is self-centered.

**How do you respond when confronted about your sin? What does this reveal about your heart?** Generally, I will confess to the Lord, but I think I am slow to repent. I will make the same sin again. I take God's grace for granted when I give in to my sin.

**How does God's response to Cain comfort or challenge you?** God loves his people, and we can always turn back to God. Even in our stubbornness, God's love and protection are still on his people.
