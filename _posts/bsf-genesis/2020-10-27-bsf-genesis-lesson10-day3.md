# Summary of Genesis 15:7-21

Genesis 15:9-10, 17 describe the ceremonial rites that sealed a covenant.

Continue from the previous conversations, Abram asked God how he will know if he will gain possession of the promised land and son. God wishes to make a covenant with Abram and instruct him to bring the animals. Abram obeyed and did what God has instructed. 

It probably took a while, and he might have waited for God for a while until he fell asleep (or God made him fell asleep). Then, God appeared and spoke to him, a prophecy of what will happen. 

The smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared that symbolizes God's presence. And passed between the animal pieces, that symbolize God swore by Himself to fulfill the covenant.
