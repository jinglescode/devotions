> Cain made love to his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch. 18 To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.
> 19 Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah. 20 Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock. 21 His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and pipes. 22 Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain’s sister was Naamah.
> 23 Lamech said to his wives,
> “Adah and Zillah, listen to me;
>     wives of Lamech, hear my words.
> I have killed a man for wounding me,
>     a young man for injuring me.
> 24 If Cain is avenged seven times,
>     then Lamech seventy-seven times.”
> 25 Adam made love to his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, “God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.” 26 Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh.
> At that time people began to call on the name of the Lord.

In Cain's family, God wasn't in their lives, or at least there were no mentioned about God at all. But God still does allow them to live lives and possibly excel in raising livestock, in music, and in handiwork. 

We see that Lamech openly declares his killing of someone as if it was a trophy or an accomplishment. Interestingly, he even declared the same words that God gave to Cain, and outperformed in by the `avenged seventy-seven times`.

# Questions

**What progress did Cain's descendants make?** They had advancement in raising livestock, in music, and in handiwork. They also had many children.

**What do you observe about the character of Cain's descendants and their relationships with God and one another?** Certainly there were no mentioned about God in this segment of scripture. God may not be part of their lives. Regarding Lamech murdering someone, they may have a vengeful spirit (like Cain) and have no respect for other's lives.

**What hope was there in Seth's birth and for all who "called on the name of the LORD"?** Since Abel was killed and Cain has left, Seth's birth signifies a means to God's promise, the coming of the seed that will crush satan.

**What warning or comfort do you want to remember from this chapter?** Seek God and dwell in his presence, rather than being away from God and dwell in destruction and sin.
