# Summary of Genesis 11:1-9

In this segment, we see that people have the confidence to rely on themselves and not rely on God. They were able to execute a plan and build for themselves a tower to boost and showcase their capability. Like many people, people before them like Adam and Eve, where they choose to eat from the tree of knowledge, to rely on self rather than on God. And like many capable people today, who has no regard for God as they are self-sufficient. God stepped in and stopped their progress. God confused their language and scattered them.

**How was the tower of Babel contrary to God’s plan for people?** God's plan is for people to worship him. But these people create an object, here a tower, to make a name for themselves. They worship themselves. Also, they do not want to scatter over the whole earth, as contrary to God's plan to fill the earth. 

**What was at the root of their desires?** They deny God and his existence. 

**How or where do these roots show up in your life?** Being self-reliant, able to do things and make decisions by self, without needing God. I tend to plan a lot because I want things and situations around me to be in control. 

**What do you learn about God from how He responds to the people and their plans?** God will not wipe them out as he did before. He spread them and confuse their languages. God sovereignty can change and replace our plans. 

**What will you pray in response to this passage and its impact on communication and unity today?** Faith and trust in God, rather than relying on self.
