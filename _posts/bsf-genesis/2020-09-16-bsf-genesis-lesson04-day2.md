focus-verse: "“If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.” – Genesis 4:7"

Cain and Abel's offerings were different; Abel brought the fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock, and Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil. God looks at the attitude of the person. Abel offered the best (fat portions) and the first (firstborn of his flock), this shows his faith and dependence on God's providence, and Cain did not.

> By faith Abel brought God a better offering than Cain did. By faith he was commended as righteous, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith Abel still speaks, even though he is dead. - Hebrews 11:4

God was more concerned with faith in the heart when we worship him.

God asked Cain, `Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?`. We can see God's love and concern towards him and told him that the offerings would be accepted if he did it right. And God also warned Cain about sin, `sin is crouching at your door`, and prevent sin from ruling over him, `you must rule over it`.

# Questions

**Compare and contrast Cain and Abel and their offerings. What stands out to you?** Abel's offering was an animal, which we can see the linkage with God made clothes for Adam and Eve with skins. Animal sacrifice is acceptable as an atonement for sin, not fruits. Also, the attitude of their hearts by what they offer is different. Abel gave the first and the best, while Cain simply gave an offering.

**Why did the Lord accept Abel and his offering but not Cain and his offering?** Abel displayed his faith and dependence on God's providence, and Cain did not.

**Name some factors that contributed to Cain's anger.** Sin is crouching into Cain's heart. His pride might have caused him to think that his brother was accepted before God, and he was not.

**How do you react when someone suggests you are wrong? Why?** Sometimes I would think about how I'm wrong, while sometimes I will quickly defend myself. Sometimes we thinking too quickly and don't think we are wrong.

**What do you learn about God from His interaction with Cain?** God gave us warnings, and we have to rule over sin, not let it master over us.
