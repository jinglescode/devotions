Eliphaz criticized Job again, rebuked him, bluntly accusing him of saying useless words of no value. He told Job that he was condemning himself more each time he spoke, and he should be asking for repentance instead. Job knew he wasn't a sinner, but these friends think otherwise. Job heard God's counsel but these friends don't believe. They also think that Job rejected their advice, thus they said: "Are Godâ€™s consolations not enough for you, words spoken gently to you?"

Eliphaz again spoke from his experiences and knowledge on the cause-and-effect between wicked people and the judgment they received. It is always true, and it is the law of nature. Thus, that is what is happening to Job. Since he is suffering, he must be wicked. But Job is defiance, and he refused to repent, is it like "he shakes his fist at God", and "with a thick, strong shield". (v25-26)

God's judgment against the wicked (v27-35). Even for people who have succeeded in the past, they will be destroyed. Eliphaz's described cause-and-effect of the ungodly and their destiny is true in many cases, but Job cased was different.

- we can't be like Job's friends, speaking relying on self knowledge and not God's wisdom
- wicked will be destroyed, it is true in many cases, traditionally
