# Summary of Genesis 15:1-6

After the war and the rescue of Lot, God appeared to Abram and revealed to him two aspects of His character, `I am your shield` and `your very great reward`. God will protect Abram; God protects us. God can protect him from all conflicts and wars, as we have seen in the previous chapter. God is also our very great reward. As God has shown himself after Lot has chosen the "good" land, God showed him that all the land would belong to him and his descendants. 

As Abram and Sarai have no children, Abram asked God a few questions. Abram must be wondering how God is planning to fulfill His promises, whether his servant Eliezer should become his heir. God clarified and told him that that is not true, and he will have a son. Despite what he can see and with his limited view, Abram believed God, and God was satisfied and credited Abram with righteousness.
