# Summary of Genesis 9:1-7

In this segment, God gave a few instructions. 

`Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth`. God told this instruction to Adam, and now to Noah. Since Noah and his family were the only people left, they have to populate the earth.

`I now give you everything`. God gave humanity to rule over all the animals and plants. It is interesting to see that in verse 2, `fear and dread of you will fall on all the beasts`, animals might have been killing people before the flood. 

`You must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it`. As blood represents life, it is precious in God's eyes, as all life matters to God, both people's lives and animal's. God also added that he punishes those who murder other people, as all humans are made in the image of God. 

# Questions

**List the commands God gave Noah. How do these compare with the commands He gave in Eden (Genesis 1:28-30)?** To be fruitful and increase in numbers. To rule over the animals, and these animals are food. Plants are food too. Do not eat meat with blood, and do not murder. 

Compare to the commands given in Eden, humans are only told to eat plants (Gen 1:29-30), but now animals can be eaten too. Also, taking another person's life was specially mentioned to Noah.

**How are God’s commands concerning people and animals reflected in your attitudes, actions or culture?** Rarely would I think about all humans are made in the image of God.

**What do you learn about God’s desires for humanity and the value of human life that challenges your interactions with others? How might this change your prayers for our world today?** All lives matter to God, and how am I reaching out to unbelievers whose spiritual life also matters to God.
