# Abram’s Family – Genesis 11:10-32

Abram originally came from Ur, a highly advanced port city at the mouth of the Euphrates River on the Persian Gulf. The archeological remains commonly considered as the city of Ur reveal its wealth, power, and idolatry. Excavations common to this area and time have uncovered two-story villas with as many as 14 rooms with plastered, whitewashed walls. Not even houses in Babylon, built 1,500 years later, compared with those of Ur. Archaeologists have discovered materials from libraries and schools. Thousands of tablets record everything from hymns to the gods of Ur to business contracts. Idolatry permeated the advanced development in Ur. Despite a family history of idolatry, when God called Abram to leave all he had ever known, he obeyed. He found that God guided him every step of the way.

# Abram’s Faith – Genesis 12:1-9

Genesis 12 records Abram’s first steps of faith. This chapter describes God’s call to Abram and his obedience to leave his home and trust God’s promise. Abram’s faith grew deeper as he walked with God. Hebrews 11:8 describes Abram’s first steps of trust in God: “By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going.” God’s call and promises to Abram reveal His faithfulness and plan to redeem humanity from sin.

# Abram’s Folly – Genesis 12:10-20

The severe shortage of food in Canaan led Abram to seek refuge in Egypt. Abram’s move seems to be driven by insecurity, self-determination and fear. Abram’s fear only increased as he moved away from God and His guidance. He feared the Egyptians would kill him to take Sarai, his beautiful wife. Abram put his own welfare above loving protection of his wife. He lied, claiming Sarai was his sister, not his wife. Perhaps he justified the lie that contained a half-truth (Sarai was his half sister). Lies often multiply to maintain effectiveness. He prepared by first asking Sarai to join in the deception and then lied to the Egyptians. Sarai was taken into Pharaoh’s harem.

Sin deceived Abram to think he would be safer outside God’s promised place of blessing rather than within His revealed will. Sin led to broken trust and disrupted relationships.
