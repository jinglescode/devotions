> When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. 7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.
> 8 Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden. 9 But the Lord God called to the man, “Where are you?”
> 10 He answered, “I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.”
> 11 And he said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”
> 12 The man said, “The woman you put here with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”
> 13 Then the Lord God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?”
> The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.” – Genesis 3:6-13

Satan has encouraged Eve to doubt the words of God and his goodness, and tempted her to place herself above God. Furthermore, this fruit could satisfy her for food, the tree was attractive, and it could make her wise. Which lines up closely to things that can tempt us today, as 1 John 2:16 puts it:

> For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world.

Eve ate the fruit and gave it to Adam, and he ate it too. Adam's sin is no less than Eve. Some people engage with temptation and give in to sin. Some people let others make decisions for them and follow into sin.
