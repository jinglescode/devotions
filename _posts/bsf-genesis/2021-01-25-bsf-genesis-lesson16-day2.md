# Questions

**3. How did Abraham's choices protect Isaac and honor all his sons?** In verse 5, we see that `Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac`. All other sons were living in the land of the east, not the same location as Isaac. 

**4. Genesis 25:7-11 honors Abraham at his death. What words show God kept His promises to Abraham? (See also Genesis 15:15; 21:11-13; 24:7.)** Abraham lived until a good old age, and had many descendants. 

**5. What do you learn about God as a promise keeper from the life of Abraham? (Review Genesis 12-24.)** Indeed, through Isaac, Ishmael (twelve tribal rulers according to their settlements and camps), and descendants of Keturah, there were many of Abraham's descendants.
