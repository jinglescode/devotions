# Summary of Genesis 19:30-38

Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains. But the daughters want children, and there was no other man around. They made their father drunk and slept with him. The corrupted Sodam has already influenced their thoughts to think that this is acceptable. They become pregnant by their father.
