# Summary of Genesis 8:1-14

In this segment of the passage, we see that Noah was waiting and testing to see if the water has receded. God has been faithful; God kept Noah and his family, and all the animals with him safe. God might not have told Noah how long it would take before they are safe to get out of the ark. But God did promise that they will be safe, and we can see this promise fulfilling here. God has covered the earth with enough water that the first raven and dove did not manage to find a place to perch. Noah used his knowledge to determine when is the best time to land. Noah waited faithfully until the last dove did not return; Noah knew the water had dried up sufficiently to inhabit the earth again. 

# Questions

**What do you notice about Noah’s actions while he waited for the earth to dry up?** He did not question God, nor did he rush to land despite the top of the mountains became visible. He sent the dove to test and search for dry land.

**Where is the meaning of “God remembered” demonstrated by God’s actions in these verses?** God promised Noah to keep him and his family safe. God is faithful and will fulfill his promises.  

**What truths about God and Noah do you want to remember?** Noah's faith led him not to rush to land despite that the top of the mountains (which can be thought of as land) can be seen. God gave Noah intellect and dove to make the right decision. We need to rely on God and ask him for wisdom. 

**What are you currently waiting on God to do? How does this passage encourage or challenge you while waiting?** I'm just clinging on to God as I continue to do BSF to see what God wants to tell me. We can learn from Noah that he did not rush and get things done.
