Humans are created by God, made in the image of God, and God breathed the breath of life into man. Interestingly God also specially made a garden for Adam to work in, it was a good place with all kinds of trees, rivers, and resources. There were also 2 trees, the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The presence of these trees is the presence of choice for Adam to decide. A choice to obey God's command (not to eat), or to rebel/disobey (to eat).

God never intended for man to be alone, but of all the creatures on earth, none is a suitable helper in all aspects of life. God used Adam’s own body to create Eve to illustrate oneness. That woman is essentially made of the same substance as a man.
