Job wanted to know why he was suffering like this, even though he was not guilty, he was being punished as if he was guilty (v2). He questioned God's purpose for letting all these happened (v3), for he believed that Job is God's work, because he believed that all his blessing comes from God (v8-12).

Job understood that God is the creator of all things, including Job himself. Job did not question why God has the right to destroy, he asked why it happened.

Job knew that God knows all things (v13), and he asked God to reveal his sin (v14). He doesn't understand why he is suffering. Job will accept his punishment if he knew what his sins were (v15). He felt that God is punishing him personally (v16-17). Job questioned about his life and existence.
