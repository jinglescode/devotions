# Summary of Genesis 21:1-13

As God had promised, Sarah gave birth to Isaac when Abraham was 100 years old. Both Abraham and Sarah knew this is the work of God. God is faithful to his words, and God can be trusted.

Later, Sarah demanded that Hagar and Ismael be sent away and not share with Isaac's inheritance. Abraham was distressed, and God responded by instructing him to do what Sarah said, for God has plans for Ismael and became a nation.
