# Summary of Genesis 19:1-14; Ezekiel 16:49-50; 2 Peter 2:5-11

Two angels came to Sodom, and Lot was at the gateway. He saw them, got them, and bowed down with his face to the ground. Lot invited them to his house and provided hospitality. Instead of spending the night at the square as they suggested, Lot seems to want to protect them from the people. The people demands for Lot to let them do whatever they want to do to the two men, Lot did not allow, and they grew violent as they were breaking down Lot’s door, the angels struck them blind. They told Lot to leave the city with his household because the city will be destroyed. But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.

# Questions

**What evidences do you find that Lot was deeply influenced by his culture and surroundings instead of deeply influencing his culture?** Despite seeing and knowing that the people in this city were wicked, he continued to stay in Sodom.

**Lot sinned by proposing grievous sin involving his daughters to resolve the men’s wicked demands (19:6-8). What do you learn about the depth of wickedness in the city?** Looks like they would have sex with anyone, male or female, young or old.

**What do you learn about God?** God will not allow these wrongdoings to go on further, struck them with blindness, and told Lot and his household to leave the city as they destroy it.

**Genesis 3 teaches every person will experience the impact of sin and wickedness, and it promises God will ultimately judge every sin. What challenges or comforts do you find in these two truths personally, or as they relate to our society today?** God does not tolerate sin and will judge everyone (like in Sodom). But he is merciful to those who follow him (like Lot).
