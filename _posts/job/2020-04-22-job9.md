Job agrees that God rewards the righteous and punishes the sinners (v2). Job understood that humans have no rights or could not debate and demand from God anything (v3). The mountains, sun, heavens, sea, all under God's control.

God is righteous and mighty, Job wonders then how he can communicate with almightly God (v14-20). How to speak of his case to God to say that he is innocent, and how to plead for mercy. He felt that there is nothing he could do to please God. If God wants to deal with him, God is too powerful that he has no chance.

Job truly believed that he was blameless, and he doesn't understand why God caused these damages to him. Even while complaining and questing about his suffering, he felt that God is distant and silent. Why God destroys both the blameless and the wicked?

Job felt that he had been judged and condemned by God; that's why he is suffering. No matter how much he cleanses himself if the sins (v30), it will still come back (v31).

Job longs for a mediator to speak to God. He felt that the distance from God, he has no way to seek God, for an answer to his sufferings. And also to take away God's judgement from him.

- God is so mightly and sovereign, who are we to negotiate with him
- We need a mediator to connect with God, Jesus
