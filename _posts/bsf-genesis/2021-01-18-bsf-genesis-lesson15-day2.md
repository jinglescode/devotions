# Summary of Genesis 24:1-14

After Sarah as passed on, Abraham too was very old. As he knows God's covenant promises, that all nations would be blessed through Isaac, he was concerned about finding Isaac a wife. He summoned the senior servant and assigned him the task to find a wife for Isaac. Abraham gave his servant clear instructions, not to get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, but someone from his own relatives. The servant sought clarity about what to do if the woman was unwilling to return, Abraham knew God will surely provide, what matters most is not compromise with false religions and immorality. 

The servant made his way to the town of Nahor, arrived, and waited at a well when women would come to draw water. The servant prayed and asked God to look for the right woman for Isaac: 
> Lord, God of my master Abraham, make me successful today, and show kindness to my master Abraham. 

He recognized this is God's work, so he requested God's help. He desires great things for his master, and not a self-centered objective for the sake of being recognized for doing a task well. His prayer is also very specific, and he waits for God to act and not rush into his own conclusion in deciding who is the one for Isaac.

By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.”
