# Summary of Genesis 28:12-15

While Jacob was sleeping, he had a dream. God was speaking to him.

> I am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying. Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring. I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.

# Questions

**9. Describe Jacob’s dream. How do Jesus’ words to Nathanael in John 1:51 help you understand the symbolism Jacob would not have fully understood? (See also John 14:6 and Hebrews 10:19-20.)** `peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring`, is referring to Jesus, as Jesus is the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through him.

**10. Give God’s personal promise to Jacob regarding: 

**a. Land** his descendants will owe the land on which he was lying

**b. Descendants** numerous as the dust of the earth, spread in every direction

**c. Blessing** peoples on earth will be blessed through him

**d. God’s presence with him** God with him and watch over him

**11. The Bible contains God’s personal promises and confirms His presence with believers. What promises of God could help or encourage you right now?** God to be with him and deliver me, and be my provider, in whom I can trust.
