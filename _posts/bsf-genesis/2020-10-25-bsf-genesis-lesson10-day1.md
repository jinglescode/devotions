# Abram and Lot – Genesis 13:1-14:16

Abram returned to where he was after fled to Egypt during a severe famine. Abram recognized and renounced self-determination in favor of trusting God, proven by his God-dependent choices in Chapter 13. But as they returned from Egypt quite wealthy, quarreling erupted between Abram's and Lot's herders. The peace and reconciliation Abram experienced with God likely raised his awareness of the danger of broken human relationships. They decided to separate from each other.

To Lot, the Jordan plain seemed ideal – well-watered like Eden and the lush land he observed in Egypt. Lot pursued what his heart desired: prosperity, comfort, honor and ease. Lot made his choice by sight and not by faith. 

As Abram seems to be at the losing end, God spoke to Abram, meeting his loss and loneliness with His own presence and promises. God wanted Abram to grasp the full reality of His amazing promise. 

In chapter 14, there was a battle between kings. An alliance of kings attacked and ruled over Sodom and other cities, the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, the ruling kings looted Sodom and Gomorrah, and Lot became their prisoner of war.

When Abram heard this, he went after Lot, overcome this mighty force to free Lot and his possessions. Abram's amazing victory made his name great among the king of Sodom and the people in that region. He became a man of standing because God was with him.

# Abram and Melchizedek – Genesis 14:17-24

The kings of Sodom and Salem met with Abram. Melchizedek, the king of Salem, praised God and blessed Abram. Melchizedek was one of the few people of that day who truly knew and worshipped God. Melchizedek's importance stems from how his meeting with Abram illustrates aspects of Christ as our Priest and King.

Abram did not win the conquest by military might, but by Almighty God's power, who deserved all honor for the victory. God Himself defeated those who served other gods, oppressed people, and sinned against Lot. Abram presented Melchizedek, as if to God Himself, a tenth of everything.
