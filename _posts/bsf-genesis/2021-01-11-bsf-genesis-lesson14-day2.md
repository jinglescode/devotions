# Summary of Genesis 22:1-10

One day, God said to Abraham:

> "Take your son, your only son, whom you love—Isaac—and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you."

Early the next morning, Abraham set off with Isaac and two servants, and wood for the burnt offering. Isaac asked his father where is the offering, and he answered, God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering. 

Abraham built an altar, arranged the wood, bound his son on top of the wood, reached out his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. God spoke and stopped him. 

# Questions

**What did Abraham know about God and Isaac when God gave His command in verse 2?**

> because it is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned (Genesis 21:12)

> Abraham reasoned that God could even raise the dead, and so in a manner of speaking he did receive Isaac back from death. (Hebrews 11:19)

Abraham knew God, and his faith is in God. Abraham knew God's word could be trusted. 

**What do you learn from this about the purpose and nature of God's tests?** 

Since God knows all things, such tests are for us to understand and evaluate our faith. Whether do we obey, or do we question God? Do we believe in God himself, or do we believe in our own planning and wisdom.

**What evidence do you see of Abraham's commitment to and belief in God?** 

Abraham did not question God, he acted upon the instructions given by God. 

**What helps you or keeps you from believing and acting on the promises of God?** 

My plans and ideas. I need to first fully surrender to God to believe and act on God's promises.

**Isaac was not a child by this time, but a young man. How does Isaac illustrate Christ's love, trust and obedience for His Father?**

> "God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son." And the two of them went on together. (Genesis 22:8)

Isaac did not doubt or question further, he trusted and obeyed. His total surrender to the situation shows that he also trusted God. Even when Isaac was bounded and laid on the altar, even when Abraham reached for the knife to slay him; we did not see any retaliation. Like Jesus, knowing that He is set to die on the cross, He did not rebel, He obeyed God.
