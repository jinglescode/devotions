> And God said, “Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years, 15 and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so. 16 God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. 17 God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth, 18 to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. 19 And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.
> 20 And God said, “Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky.” 21 So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 22 God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.” 23 And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.
> 24 And God said, “Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind.” And it was so. 25 God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. – Genesis 1:14-25

# Summary of Genesis 1:14-25

God created the sun, moon, and stars on the fourth day. We know the importance of the sun, it provides us warm, and it supports life. The moon stabilizes our climate, weather, and causes tides. The stars provided a means to measure time and direction.

God created birds and sea creatures on the fifth day. A great variety of birds and sea creatures were created, according to their kind. There are so many species, and God created them all.

Likewise, God created land creatures, each according to its kind. Evolution is the gradual change of one kind of organism into another kind, but this isn't the case, God created each one of them, every single species, and types.
