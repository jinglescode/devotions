# Summary of Genesis 19:30-38

Abimelek recognized that God is with Abraham in everything he does, and they want to seek peace between them. So Abimelek and his army commander, Phicol, approached Abraham seeking a formal promise that he would treat them with kindness. Abraham agreed. Abraham also raised an issue about the well, and they resolved it with a treaty. 

Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the Lord, the Eternal God.
