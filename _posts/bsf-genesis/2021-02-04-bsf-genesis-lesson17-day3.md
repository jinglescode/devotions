# Questions

**7. a. What did Rebekah show Jacob by the way she treated God and her family members (27:14-17)?** Rebekah wanted to fool Issac and stole the blessings from Esau. She has a plan and do not respect God nor Issac.

**b. What do the actions of Jacob and Isaac reveal about their attitude toward God and each other (27:18-26)?** Isaac doesn't seem to know his sons well. Both of them acted in man-centered wisdom, not according to spiritual wisdom.

**8. What do you learn from this event about how family relationships can fall short of what God intends?** Without God being the centre of relationships, we can easily slip into our own selfish desires and ways. Letting our own selfishness be the basis of our actions.

**9. How does God’s prophetic blessing through Isaac in verses 27-29 help you better understand how His sovereignty overrules sin?** He knew that God wanted him to have the birthright, he justified any lie or other sin he committed in the pursuit of the birthright. He likely did so telling himself that it was all for a righteous cause.
