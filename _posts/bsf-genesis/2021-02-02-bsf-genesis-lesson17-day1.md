# The Passing of the Patriarch – Genesis 25:1-20

God fulfilled His promise to Abraham, “You, however, will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age” (Genesis 15:15). he “died at a good old age” and “an old man and full of years.” The later years of human life bring physical challenges but also rich opportunities. Those who have walked with God over long years and through many life experiences can approach old age as a time to celebrate and share the wonders of God’s faithfulness.

Abraham died, but his legacy continued through his sons. The Old Testament typically lists the lineage outside the covenant first then the messianic line last. Such is the case here, with the records of Ishmael and Isaac. 

# The Battle of the Brothers – Genesis 25:21-34

Rebekah was childless; Isaac did not take another woman to bear him a child. Instead, Isaac patiently prayed for Rebekah and waited on God. Isaac and Rebekah waited 20 years for children. God answered Isaac’s prayer and Rebekah became pregnant. Challenges came alongside the joy of Rebekah’s pregnancy. The babies “jostled each other within her” so violently that she took her concern straight to the Lord. Isaac and Rebekah offer an example of practical faith in balancing the challenges of life and the promises of God.

The individuality of Rebekah’s twins was evident from birth. Esau was born first. Jacob was born “with his hand grasping Esau’s heel.” Their struggles started in the womb, festered into sibling rivalry and led to different destinies. Their paths in life fulfilled God’s prophecy, but their own attitudes and choices contributed. Jacob sought
and valued the birthright in a way Esau did not.
The passage does not clarify whether he sought
the benefits of the inheritance or valued God’s yet unfulfilled promises. However, Jacob did not wait
for God to provide what He promised. Instead, he schemed to obtain both the birthright and the blessing through manipulation and self-effort. Jacob relied on his ingenuity to selfishly capitalize on his brother’s weakness. Jacob possibly chose a time when he knew Esau would return tired and hungry to cook a favored stew.

# The Dilemmas of Daily Life – Genesis 26

Daily life can present situations that threaten our well- being. Isaac experienced famine, a challenge that impacted daily survival. Isaac repeated his father’s response, sought a human solution and decided to move his family to Egypt. We do not know if Abraham or Sarah ever warned Isaac about their failings in Egypt. Even though God directly communicated His promises to Isaac, he was gripped with fear. Isaac repeated his father’s sin. Rebekah was beautiful like Isaac’s mother, Sarah. Like his father, Isaac feared for his own life more than for his wife’s honor and safety. He lied and said Rebekah was his sister.
