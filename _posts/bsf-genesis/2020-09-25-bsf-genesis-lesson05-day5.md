# Summary of Genesis 7

In this chapter, we see the phrase, `Noah did all that the Lord commanded him` (and similar phrases), was mentioned a few times. Noah was obedient and worked by faith.

God told Noah, and his family to enter the ark. God also brought all the various animals of all kinds to enter the ark. God shut them in the ark, began to rain for 40 days. The water rose and flooded the earth and covered the mountains and every living thing on earth.
