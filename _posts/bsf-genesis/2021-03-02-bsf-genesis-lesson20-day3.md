# Summary of Genesis 30:14-24

Reuben, Leah's son, found some mandrake plants, which Rachel wanted and asked for some. Rachel gave Jacob to Leah to sleep with her in exchange for the mandrake. Leah agreed, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Issachar, Zebulun, and Dinah. Later, God enabled Rachel to conceive, and she gave birth to Joseph.
