**Psalm 148** `praise the name of the Lord, for at his command they were created`. Indeed, God spoke, and light, stars, and life were created. That is the greatness of God. `praise the name of the Lord, for his name alone is exalted; his splendour the earth and the heavens.` God does not need to prove and give us reasons why he is worthy of worship in our daily life. We often forget and did not recognise God's splendour. 

**Job 38-40** God created all things and orchestrated all things. Where and how Earth was created and positioned in the universe. Formation of ice, water and dew. Provide prey for the lioness and satisfy the hunger of the lions and provides food for the raven.

# Questions

**What is your takeaway about God and creation?** God made all things, provided all living things, life. God planned and orchestrated all that will happen to all creations.

**What are the implications for your daily life based on these truths?** God doesn't owe us anything, and God doesn't need to answer my prayers to be worthy of worship. God alone, his splendour, and his glory is enough for me to worship him.
