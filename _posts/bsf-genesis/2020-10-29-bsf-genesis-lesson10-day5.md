# Summary of Genesis 16:7-16

After Hagar fled from Sarai, God appeared to her. God knew her and her identity and what she has been through. God instructed her to go back to Abram and Sarai and added that she would have descendants so much that they will be too numerous to count. God told her to name the son Ishmael and provided a prophecy of what will happen to him.

**What promises did the angel of the Lord make to Hagar, and who did she believe the angel of the Lord to be?** God himself appeared and spoke to Hagar. God told her to return to Sarai and submit to her, that she will give birth to a son and name him Ishmael.

**What do you learn about God through His care for Hagar and Ishmael?** God's care is not limited to only some selected people. Hagar, a slave, is also entitled to God's care. 

**How has God provided unimaginable good to you through a seemingly impossible situation?** He has brought me to thus far and situations that I have never expected to be in.
