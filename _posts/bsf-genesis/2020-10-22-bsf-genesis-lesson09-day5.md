# Summary of Genesis 14:17-24

After Abram has come back from defeating Kedorlaomer, two kings came and meet him, king of Sodom and Salem.

The king of Salem, Melchizedek, was also a priest, and he blessed Abram and praised God. Melchizedek understood that Abram's victory is because of God.

On the other hand, the king of Sodom requested to take the people while Abram can keep the possessions. But Abram does not need any possessions; his faith has grown to know that God will provide for him.
