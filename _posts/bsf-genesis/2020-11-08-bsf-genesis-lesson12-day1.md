# God's Symbol of an Unbreakable Covenant – Genesis 17

About 13 years passed between the end of Genesis 16 and the beginning of Genesis 17. This suggests God had not given Abram a new direction or communication during that time. Then God spoke to him, with a strong statement of His Person and power, "I am God Almighty." and instructed him to "walk before me faithfully and be blameless." Abram fell facedown, shows his profound reverence, awe, and humility toward God. God repeats His promises to confirm Abram's faith and gave a new identity to him, Abraham, "father of many nations." God also gave a covenant for all in Abraham's household. God instructed for male circumcision for Abraham and his male descendants. Participation in circumcision affirmed each man's acceptance of God's covenant personally. God also gave Sarai a new name, Sarah. And promise a son to be delivered through Sarah next year. This clarifying promise regarding Sarah stretched Abraham's faith once again as God led him to trust Him more than his own understanding.

# God's Call to an Unwavering Faith – Genesis 18:1-15

Three men came near Abraham, though Abraham did not recognize God, Abraham graciously and eagerly received the three visitors and served them with modesty and grace. Once again, they mention that a son that will bear through Sarah. Sarah heard and laughed in unbelief. But the men pointed out, "Is anything too hard for the Lord?". The God who knows everything can do anything He chooses to do. God's unlimited power upholds every one of His promises.
