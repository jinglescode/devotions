# Summary of Genesis 20

Now Abraham and Sarah were living in Gerar, and just like in Genesis 12 where Abraham was concerned about his safety and well-being, he declared Sarah was his sister. Once again, God acted and warned Abimelek, God intervened and protected Sarah.

Abimelek responded to God, summoned all his officials, and when he told them all that had happened. He also confronted Abraham and asked him about what he has done. Abraham’s failure brought trouble upon Abimelek and his kingdom. Abimelek gave Abraham gifts, animals, slaves, and let them live anywhere.

In this chapter, we can clearly see that Abraham made the same sin, and God again acted and protected. God faithfully protected Sarah and Abraham despite
Abraham’s unfaithfulness. God is infinitely stronger than human failure.

# Questions

**When and under what circumstances did Abraham and Sarah commit the same sin?** Abraham relies on his know-how to protect themselves (relying on the same faulty scheme) rather than trusting God to protect them. 

**How can you identify with Abraham?** When I see the problem I am facing at the moment, I focused on the problem and forgot that God is much bigger and can deal with my problems.

**What sinful acts are in danger of becoming sinful patterns in your life?** The habit of trusting in my own wisdom and know-how rather than seek `seek first his kingdom and his righteousness` (Matt 6:33).

**How did God work through the situation?** God has shown me that in Matt 7.
> 24 “Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 25 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. 26 But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. 27 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.”

That all my effort is like a foolish builder who builds a house on sand, it will not last, and it will crash when troubles hit.

**In what situation is God asking you to trust Him instead of engineering your own solutions?** In all my life, all my efforts, to surrender to him. Because mine doesn't last, but instead, store treasures in Heaven.

Matt 6: 
> 19 “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 20 But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
