# Summary of Genesis 27:1-13

Isaac is getting old, his eyes were weak, and he called Esau to prepare him a tasty meal, and he will bless him after eating. Rebekah heard and instructed Jacob to get young goats, and she will prepare the meal the way Issac liked. 

Whether or not she thought she was upholding God's decreed will, Rebekah sought to undermine Isaac's plan with her own manipulative scheme. She was not trusting God to deliver what He had promised. Rebekah sought to fulfill God's plan and her desires in her own way, rather than waiting on God.
