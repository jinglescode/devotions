Job told these friends, that what they have mentioned are not wisdom. Their words contain common proverbs, and things about God that is so elementary that people know, even animals know (v2-3, 7-9). Job again stated that he is righteous and blameless, he called on God and God answered; but he is now mocked.

God describes God's power and wisdom, to create and to destroy. God has power over men, minds, wise, rulers, darkness, nations, reasons.

- to "use" God's wisdom, we need to be rooted in God's word
- God has power over everything
