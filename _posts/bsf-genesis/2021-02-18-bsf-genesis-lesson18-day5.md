# Summary of Genesis 28:16-22

Jacob woke up, and realize that God was present. He took the stone, poured oil and he made a vow:

> If God will be with me and will watch over me on this journey I am taking and will give me food to eat and clothes to wear so that I return safely to my father's household, then the Lord will be my God and this stone that I have set up as a pillar will be God's house, and of all that you give me I will give you a tenth.

# Questions

**12. What stands out to you about Jacob's response to the presence and promises of God?** He realized how powerful God is, and the only response is to humble and bow before God.

**13. How are you encountering God through your study of Genesis this year?** I'm still waiting on God to deliver and provide, like how he had provided for those in Genesis.

**14. How is God calling you to commit to fully trusting Him? What is holding you back?** I trust God, nothing is holding me back. I'm just unsure why God isn't acting. True that we have to wait, and Abraham waited for many years. I'm not sure how long do I have to wait.
