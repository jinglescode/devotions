# Abraham Offers Isaac as a Test of Faith – Genesis 22

In Genesis 22:1, we can see `God tested Abraham`, and in verse 2, God spoke to Abraham, `Take your son, your only son, whom you love—Isaac—and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you.` God tested Abraham so Abraham would know what God already knew – that Abraham was willing to offer God what he loved most. God’s request to Abraham was that he offers his son as a “burnt offering,” an atoning sacrifice for sin. Many years later, God, the heavenly Father, offered His one and only Son as an atoning sacrifice for the sins of the world. Abraham knew the one true God. He called on the name of the Lord, and the Lord called on him. When Abraham received this unique command directly from God, he did not question God. Abraham knew the eternal God could be trusted. He had walked with God, who had proven His faithfulness through many years and overwhelming challenges. Abraham understood that God kept His promises. 

Hebrews 11:17-19:
> 17 By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had embraced the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son, 18 even though God had said to him, “It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.” 19 Abraham reasoned that God could even raise the dead, and so in a manner of speaking he did receive Isaac back from death.

## What was God’s Purpose?

- God’s test benefited Abraham. God already knew the quality of Abraham’s love for Him, but Abraham needed to know himself that he loved God above all others.
- God’s test benefits all believers who inherit His promises to Abraham.
- God’s test ultimately benefits all people. Through Abraham’s faith, God provided a physical preview of the substitutionary, sacrificial death and resurrection of the Son of promise, Jesus Christ.

Abraham immediately and deliberately obeyed God’s command. He obeyed “early the next morning.” Abraham himself prepared the things needed for the trip rather than rely on his servants. For three days, Abraham traveled forward with his son, the wood, fire, and the knife. Abraham proved to God, himself, angels, demons, and future generations that he fully loved and trusted God. He allowed nothing, not even his only son, to divide his affections from wholehearted union with God. He completed the test by faithful obedience to God; he surrendered completely. God’s goal appears to be evidence of Abraham’s surrender, not the sacrifice of Isaac. Abraham exercised his faith and learned that his love for God and Isaac was deeper than he ever imagined.

# Abraham Buries Sarah in an Expression of Faith – Genesis 23

Sarah and Abraham displayed the companionship and close affection of marriage between two believers. They both struggled and grew together in their walk of faith. Abraham wept and mourned her death. Abraham actively expressed his faith in God’s promises as he buried Sarah. 

Abraham approached his neighbors with graciousness and humility. He asked the Hittites to purchase a burial plot for Sarah. He believed that God had given him the land but did not demand or take the land by military force. The Hittites honored his presence among them and offered their best tombs. Abraham buried Sarah and intentionally purchased the first piece of ground to belong to God’s people officially. Abraham dealt honorably with his neighbors because he trusted God.
