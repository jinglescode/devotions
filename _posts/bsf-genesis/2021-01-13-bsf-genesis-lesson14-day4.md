# Summary of Genesis 22:15-24

After God has stopped Abraham from sacrificing Isaac, God said: 

> I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies, and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed me.”

# Questions

**Why did God swear by Himself to bless Abraham?** God will fulfill the promises He made.

**What two-part promise did God make to Abraham?**

- bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore
- your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies, and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed

**How was God’s oath to Abraham fulfilled?** 

> The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. Scripture does not say “and to seeds,” meaning many people, but “and to your seed,” meaning one person, who is Christ. (Galatians 3:16)

`through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed`, we can see that this `offspring` is referred to Christ, that through Christ all nations on earth will be blessed.

**How does this passage change your thinking about the blessings and gifts God gives to you?** God's gift comes to those who obey him, and it comes only at the time that God chose. Our role is to live out our faith in our daily life.

**What promises of God are most helpful to you right now?** `The Lord Will Provide`.
