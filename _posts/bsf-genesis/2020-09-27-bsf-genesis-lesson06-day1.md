Chapter 5 describes each generation's family records and knows that this family keeps God's knowledge throughout the generations.

# Sin's Corruption on the Earth – Genesis 6:1-7:10

In contrast to Genesis 5, Genesis 6 describes a world of human wickedness, and God's judgment to wipe them out. Amid a sinful world, Noah was found to be righteous in God's eye; he was chosen to be part of God's plan. Certainly, God was upset about humanity and their sin; God is holy, and his judgment on sin must happen. But yet, at the same time, we see God's perfect and uncompromised love, grace, and mercy; when God chooses Noah to accomplish His plans. Noah was faithful and obedient; he did all that God had commanded him.
