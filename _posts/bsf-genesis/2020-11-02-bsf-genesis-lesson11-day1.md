# God's Promise and Abram's Covenant – Genesis 15

God met Abram's needs, not with a timeline or dates on a calendar, but with a reminder of two important aspects of His character:
"I am your shield." 
- Scripture often reminds us to put off fear. Our human tendency is to be afraid. Believing the truth about God overcomes our fear.
I am "your very great reward." 
- Abram had just refused great financial reward from the king of Sodom. Now, God revealed that Abram had chosen the very best reward. God's presence and pleasure gave deeper joy and satisfaction than any earthly possession.

Ten years had passed since God promised a son, but Abram and Sarai were still childless. So Abram asked God about his doubt and discouragement. Abram's impatience was an understandable human response – how could God now fulfill His promise? God spoke to Abram in a uniquely personal way to capture his heart. God's clarifying promise of a physical son encouraged Abram to believe God could do the impossible, even give life to a body that was as good as dead. God's truth provides perspective and hope when we are confused and discouraged. God gave him a binding covenant that included a ceremony, a prophecy, and a sign.

# Abram and Sarai's Sin and Hagar's Flight – Genesis 16

God intended to fulfill His promise to Abram only through Sarai, though Isaac's miraculous birth proves God's almighty power. But Abram wrongly assumed Eliezer would be his heir; he misinterpreted God's promise by assuming that because a child had not to be born to Sarai, he should agree to her offer of Hagar. There is no mention that Abram and Sarai sought God in making this decision. God allowed Abram and Sarai to carry out their plan and for Hagar to conceive a child. The son born to Hagar represents human self-effort outside of God's covenant of grace. This wrong decision immediately brought pain to the entire household.

Hagar fled, rejected, abused, pregnant, and alone in the desert. God loved Hagar that He stepped into her desperate situation to give her help and hope. God called Hagar by name and asked her to share her plans and actions. God gave Hagar two corrective instructions: return and submit. God offered hope to hurting Hagar. Hagar encountered God, recognized His voice and demonstrated faith.
