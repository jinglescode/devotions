# Abraham's Intercession for Sodom – Genesis 18:16-33

God has chosen Abraham, and God described Abraham's future, that he would become a great influence, his descendants will be numerous, and they will be blessed:

> Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through him. For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is right and just, so that the Lord will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him.

God's relationship with Abraham has also led to God revealing his plans to destroy the city of Sodom. Again and again, we see how God does not tolerate sin; God's involvement to act against sin helps us understand the gravity of sin.

But at the same time, Abraham seems to know the extend of God's mercy; he asked God that for the sake of 10 righteous people, God would not destroy Sodom. Abraham did not delight in God's judgment but trusted in His righteousness.

# God's Judgment on Sodom – Genesis 19

Lot saw the two angels, bow before them, and invited them to his house to protect them from the city's evil people. Later in the chapter, we see that the people in this city are filled with sexual immorality, demanding the two visitors to come out to have sex with them. Lot tried his best to protect them and even offered his daughters to spare his guest (the two angels) from harm. But he got overpowered, and the angels acted, strike the people with blindness.

The angels have seen enough and warned Lot to get out of the city, as it will be destroyed. Lot escaped the city, and God rain burning sulfur upon the city and destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.
