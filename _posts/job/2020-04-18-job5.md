Eliphaz described the fate of a foolish man, is one that great disaster fell upon him. That hardship and trouble do not just spring up from nowhere. There must be a reason for them (v6).

Eliphaz suggested seeking God, to appeal to God, because God can work in ways we cannot fathom (v8-9). God is able to provide (v10). Those who are humble and mourning, those who are needy and poor, they will be helped, and their hope is in God (v11&15-16), but those who have lots of plans their plans will not succeed (v12-13).

Blessed are those whom God corrects, for he wounds, but he also binds up; he injures, but his hands also heal. (v17). Will be delivered (v20), and will be protected (v21).

- Eliphaz analysis is based on his own experiences (v3), though he may not be wrong, he still reminded us of a few valuable lessons. Foolish people will eventually seek destruction.
- God disciplines us to correct us to keep us from that destruction, for his punishment, wounds and injuries, he can heal and bind up.
- God will help the helpless and bring down those who are proud.
