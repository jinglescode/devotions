Job considers the number of days on earth short and full of troubles. Like flowers, like shadow, fleeting and frail. Even trees can "resurrect" but humans dont. Perhaps God demands something of him that he is unable to do or meet God's standard. And he wished that God would look away or stop, so the suffering would stop and he could rest.

Job longs for the grave, he rather dies than going through his current misery. "Will they live again?" was answered by Jesus, through salvation. Job is hopeful, for renewal, and for God to call. We wait for change to come. He hoped for a restoration of relationship with God. Job described God mighty power, that God can destroy a person's hope. Job's sufferings and his feelings about what he has been through is real.

- Despite how bad the situation might be, in the end still long for God relationship and restoration. That's the only thing left that matter.
