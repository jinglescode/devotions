# Summary of Genesis 17:9-14; 23-27

God instructed Abraham to be circumcised, including those born in the household and those who are not his offspring. This is an outward sign of the covenant between God and Abraham. This distinguished Abraham's male descendants from other people as these people are set apart for God. Abraham did exactly what he was told.
