# God Created – Genesis 1:1-2
God made everything, the universe, the Earth, you and me, that means we are accountable to Him. John 1:3 affirms, `Through Him all things were made; without Him nothing was made that has been made.`

# God Formed – Genesis 1:3-13
From day 1 to 3, God created and separated three elements; light from the darkness, sky from the surface, and land from the water. We worship the God who created light and who Himself is light. From 1 John 1:5, `God is light; in Him there is no darkness at all.` We worship the God who stands above us and apart from us but calls us to know Him. We worship the God whose beauty and majesty are inexhaustible. 

# God Filled – Genesis 1:14-25
From day 4 to 6, God created and filled the Earth; Sun and moon, seasons and time, all kinds of creatures in the sky, water, and land. `Great is Thy Faithfulness` magnifies God's faithfulness and is seen through creation, from each sunrise and from each season to season. We worship a God whose plans and provisions order our lives with loving precision. We worship God, who is the giver of life. We worship the God of creation.

# And God saw that it was good.
Creation is good because God made it and declared it good in and of itself. The goodness of creation reveals God's nature. If God finds creation good, we must find creation good as well. We should be thankful for God's creation and praise Him for it. We should delight in creation. We should demonstrate responsibility for creation.

# Questions

**Use this space to record how you have seen God's activity during the week. (How has He provided, answered, comforted, reconciled, guided, etc.?)** Where I am now, what I've been through, and what I will be facing in future, are created and happened purposefully to display God's glory. How am I acting responsibly with what God has done?

**What from the notes, lecture, group sharing or personal study impacted you most in the past week?** There is much about God that we cannot fully understand. However, God's unlimited power and authority rightly lead us to respectful and holy "fear" before His greatness, lead us to breathless awe and humble worship Him.
