# Summary of Genesis 18:16-33

God chose Abraham to become a great and powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through him. For that, God is expecting him to know and do what is right and just. In this scripture, God may be teaching him what is right and just. Sodom and Gomorrah are so great and their sin so grievous, but if there are righteous people there, is it right and just to destroy the entire city? God’s personal involvement in executing judgment helps us understand the gravity of sin. God does not tolerate sin. But at the same time, we see God’s mercy and patience are great.
