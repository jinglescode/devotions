# Summary of Genesis 19:15-29

This segment describes Lot leaving Sodom and God destroying the cities. The angels instructed Lot to flee to the mountains, but Lot requested to spare the town, Zoar, where he will flee from the destruction. Early the next morning, Abraham looked at Sodom and Gomorrah and saw smoke, knowing that God has destroyed the cities.

# Questions

**How does Scripture describe Lot's family's departure from Sodom and Gomorrah? Why would Lot hesitate to leave?** `When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city`. God's mercy made the angel force them to leave the city. It could be because the sons-in-law were not with them. It could be because he would lose all his possessions. 

**What do you learn about judgment from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah?** God will judge and destroy those who chose not to repent. God's judgment also comes suddenly to the people, it could be just another day in their life, and God's judgment strikes them. 

**What are you holding onto or longing for that may be destructive for you or your family?** Pride is certainly an issue. Thinking that my ways and my plans are better than God's.
