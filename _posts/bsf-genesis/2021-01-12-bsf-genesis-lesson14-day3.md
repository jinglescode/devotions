# Questions

**What did God want from Abraham?** Abraham's surrender and obedience. 

**Where do you sense God is testing you? How are you doing with the test? What are you learning from it?** God is testing me on my reliance on him or on myself. It is clear that I trusted myself more than trusting in God, and God has shown to me that he is far greater than whatever ideas and plans I can conceive. I'm still upset and worrying, I'm still waiting and hoping for the day when God speaks to me and shows me personally that I can call *The Lord Will Provide*.

**What is a substitute?** An appropriate replacement.

**Where has God demonstrated His willingness to do what He asked Abraham to do?** God provided a ram for the offering, which God has asked Abraham to do. 

**What is your response to God's provision of His Son to take away your sin? How does this give you the strength to say "yes" to God when everything inside of you says "no"?** I'm thankful for God's provision to take away sins because that is something that no human work can accomplish.
