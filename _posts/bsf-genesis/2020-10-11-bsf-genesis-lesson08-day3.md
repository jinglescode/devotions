# Summary of Genesis 12:1-3

> The Lord had said to Abram, “Go from your country, your people and your father’s household to the land I will show you.
> “I will make you into a great nation,
>     and I will bless you;
> I will make your name great,
>     and you will be a blessing.
> I will bless those who bless you,
>     and whoever curses you I will curse;
> and all peoples on earth
>     will be blessed through you.”

Genesis 12 starts off with God's call to Abram to leave his father's household to the land which God will show. He did not know where to go and for what purpose. But we know that Abram was obedient, as version 4 wrote, `So Abram went, as the Lord had told him` and Hebrews 11 mentioned that he went by faith. It is necessary to trust God and step out of our comfort zone in obedience.

Even before he began the journey, God already has a plan, and there are several promises that God gave Abram. We see that God will continue his plan to bring salvation to the world by making Abram into a great nation (Israel). God's blessing to the people will also come through Abram. The verse on `all peoples on earth will be blessed through you`, could because Jesus is Abram's descendant and will fulfill God's plan to bring salvation to all people.

# Questions

**Compare God's call and command to Abram with His promises.** `I will make you into a great nation` for being fruitful on earth and Jesus, who is Abram's descendant who will bring salvation to all people. Likewise for `all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.”`, where Jesus is the promised messiah. 

**What does Acts 7:2-4 reveal about the place and timing?** He was in Mesopotamia, and his father, Terah, was with him. They traveled to Harran, and his father died there. 

**What else does God's Word say about His call to live by faith in Him?** In Isaiah 41:8-10, God choose you and will strengthen you and help you. In Matthew 4:18-22, Jesus called Simon and Andrew, at once they left their nets and followed him. In Mark 8:34-36, Jesus said that we must deny ourselves and take up their cross and follow him. In Hebrew 11:6, without faith, it is impossible to please God.

**What might God be calling you to do, leave or offer to Him?** Do not worry about pursuing my dreams; follow him.

**How do God's presence and promises strengthen you to answer His call?** God chose, and God will provide those who follow him. This gives confidence that God's way will be more certain than my way.
