# Abraham’s Mandate – Genesis 24:1-9

As spiritual head of his family, Abraham took the initiative to please God in this important family matter. He assigned the task of finding Isaac a wife to his senior servant. This servant’s faith in God and faithfulness to Abraham offers an example for all believers. Abraham gave his servant clear instructions, that he desired a wife for Isaac from his own family. Abraham rejected the possibility of Isaac marrying a Canaanite because danger existed regarding compromise with false religions and immorality. 

# The Servant’s Mission – Genesis 24:10-61

Abraham’s servant arrived and sat at a well outside town to water the camels. By God’s design, he arrived at the time of day when women would come to draw water. He knew that the God who led him this far would show him the next right thing. He prayed for wisdom about what to do, where to go and what to say. The servant had confidence God would answer his prayer for Abraham’s sake. Those who pray surrendered to God’s purpose and character look expectantly for His answer. 

Examine the faith expressed in the servant’s prayer.
- **Honorable** – He recognized he brought his request before Almighty God.
- **Humble** – He, a mere servant, appealed to God’s love for Abraham, his master and God’s friend.
- **Faithful** – He sought to accomplish what his master asked of him.
- **Specific** – He requested God indicate the woman by her offer to water the camels. This was reasonable and practical.
- **Expectant** – He knew God would help him keep his promise to Abraham. He waited on God to work.

God began to answer the servant’s prayer before he even finished praying. Rebekah walked up to the well with her water jar on her shoulder. The servant demonstrated his faith by action. He “hurried” to meet her. The servant took another step to affirm God’s direction. He offered Rebekah gifts, asked whose daughter she was and asked for lodging in her father’s house. When Rebekah identified herself as Nahor’s granddaughter, the servant bowed in humble, grateful worship. His words of praise celebrated God’s faithfulness and guidance.

# Isaac’s Marriage – Genesis 24:62-67

Isaac trusted God with his personal happiness and future. Isaac expressed his expectant faith by waiting at Beer Lahai Roi to meet his bride. He looked up to see approaching camels, an answer to his prayers. Rebekah saw him and verified that the man was Isaac. As Rebekah covered herself with a veil in preparation to meet Isaac, she followed a custom many today recognize when a veiled bride walks down the aisle. This faithful bride accepted Isaac as a gift from God.

He will accomplish everything He plans and promises. But along the way He gives us the privilege of seeking Him in prayer. He listens, responds and allows us to experience His faithfulness so our faith will grow. God’s sovereign plan for your life incorporates your prayers. The truth of Proverbs 3:5-6 applies to Genesis 24: “Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.”
