# Summary of Genesis 11:10-32

Genesis 11 recorded for us the family line of Shem to Abram. Linking with Genesis 5, we can connect the generations back to Adam. We also see that these generations lived a shorter life compared to those named in Genesis 5. 

Then, scripture recorded the people surrounding Abram, his father, his brothers, and their wives, and their children. We were also introduced to Sarai, Abram's wife, who was childless and was not able to conceive.
