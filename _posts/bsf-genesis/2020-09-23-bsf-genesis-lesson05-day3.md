# Summary of Genesis 6

Genesis 5 mentions about the rising wickedness in people, and God's plan to destroy all living creatures. Here, we see God's righteousness and judgment of sin. Amid a sinful world, Noah was a righteous man, he was blameless, and he walked faithfully with God. He was found favor in God's eyes, and he was instructed to carry out God's plan – to build an ark. God must act in judgment and have compassion for his creation. God established a covenant with Noah that he and his family will be safe from judgment. God is detailed in his instructions on how the ark should be made, materials and measurements. And Noah did everything just as God commanded him.
