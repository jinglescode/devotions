# God's World Declares His Glory

The bible starts with Genesis, which opens with a burst of symphonic grandeur – God's work in creation. The created world offers indisputable evidence that God exists and can be known. God's creation recognizes the Creator through creation. By recognizing our Creator rightly leads us to humble ourselves before our great God.

# God's Word Declares His Glory

Moses writes Genesis for the Hebrew people who were redeemed by God from slavery in Egypt. Moses' original purposes for writing was to show these newly redeemed people who they are and to whom they belong. A core truth discovered in Genesis is: The God who creates is also the God who redeems. Genesis reveals to us:

- God's character and creation
- Humanity's origin and purpose
- Humanity's fall into sin
- God's promise and plan of redemption

# God's People and Plan Declare His Glory

God has plans for his people. Since the beginning, God established human dignity, work, marriage, family, covenants, nations, corporate worship and civilizations. God has plans for Moses and Abraham, His own Son coming to earth clothed in human flesh, and plans for each one of us. The history and future of humanity and the course of our lives rest firmly in His big and powerful plan. In a world that screams chaos and confusion, God provides an unshakeable foundation for those who believe Him. God's promise to deliver His people and His world is our only hope.

# Take to Heart

A grounded, meaningful life begins as you recognize God as your powerful Creator and intimate Father. He is the beginning and source of a fruitful life, personality and purpose. This means we must make Him the centre of our plans, personalities, friendships, family, schedules, careers, imaginations and desires through faith. God's best path for your life begins as you trust Him to begin new works in your life and relationships, for His glory.

# Questions

**Use this space to record how you have seen God's activity during the week. (How has He provided, answered, comforted, reconciled, guided, etc.?)** With the start of BSF this week, on Genesis 1 which reminds us about the beginning and God's creation, and on the group discussion question on a recent "new beginning" in our life; it coincides with me to restart my journey with God in my plans. This is a good reminder or a way God has provided, answered or lead the way to bring me back on track.

**What from the notes, lecture, or thoughts about the Genesis study impacted you most in the past week?** By recognizing God as the powerful Creator and intimate Father, that is the beginning and source of a fruitful life, personality and purpose. That means I have to make Him the centre of my plans. It's difficult. 

> Dear God, I am ready to start anew with you, to make you the centre of my plans, thoughts and time. Let me recognize and trust you as the mighty one, as you begin a new work in my life.
