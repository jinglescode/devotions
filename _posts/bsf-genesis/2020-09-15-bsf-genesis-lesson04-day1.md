# The Choice to Sin – Genesis 3:1-6

There is a stark contrast between Genesis 1 & 2, and Genesis 3. God's creation was perfect, and Adam enjoyed unhindered fellowship with God in the perfect garden. But in chapter 3, sin entered the world, there is a separation between humanity and God, and Adam got banished from the perfect garden.

Satan does everything he can to cast doubt on God and his promises. Satan's lies contain enough truth to hook us. He accused God of withholding good things from Eve (and us). He crafted his deceptive words to conceal his deliberate intent and caused us to disobey God. Satan's words caused Eve to see God's command seems unfair. He also called God a liar when he said that they would not actually die. We must not negotiate with satan, as Eve let Satan cast enough doubt on what she knew that her understanding of God shifted and became distorted. Eve should have rejected Satan's words and turned to God and Adam for help. 

# The Consequences of Sin – Genesis 3:7-24 

Sin entered the world and immediately destroyed the original peace and harmony of God's creation. Sin distorts our view of self and others. The face-to-face, voice-to-voice communion with God that Adam and Eve had so enjoyed is now shattered. Their purity and privilege to walk God in a perfect garden were destroyed by their willing choice to sin. Their sin delivered dreadful consequences inherited by all humans. 

God seeks for them; God does not abandon us to our fallen state. But instead of confession and repentance, they blame each other. True confession accepts full responsibility for every wrong motive and action. Rather than owning what they had done, they justified themselves and shifted the blame on others. Facing the reality of personal sin and brokenness offers a healing first step back to God.

Nevertheless, God gave hope for redemption; a hope of a Savior includes a promised seed, a sacrificial offering, and eternal life. To conquer satan, Jesus suffered for us. In victory, Jesus reconciled us to the Father, providing us with a new life. Jesus bore the price of our sin for all who believe in Him. Only Jesus can restore what sin costs and loss. God covers our sin with Jesus' perfection. When God looks at a believer, He sees only the righteousness of His own Son. We are all sinners,
but we have a great Savior.
