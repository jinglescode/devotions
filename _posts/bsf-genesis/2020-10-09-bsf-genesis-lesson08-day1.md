# Noah's Sin and Noah's Sons – Genesis 9:18-10:32 

So far, we have seen how Noah has been obedient to all that God has called him to. He has experienced God personally, and his faithfulness, but he was not immune to temptation and sin, his sin rose from within his own sinful nature. He lay naked and drunk. His three sons have different reactions. Ham saw his father's nakedness, and rather than protect him; he told his two brothers. Shem and Japheth chose the honorable response of refusing to speak of their father's embarrassing exposure. They entered the tent backward to avoid dishonoring Noah and covered his nakedness. They illustrated the truth that "love does not delight in evil". When Noah was awake, he prophesies the state of his three sons and their nations.

# The Tower of Babel – Genesis 11:1-9 

As people population has grown, the people settled and committed to building a city with a tower reaching heaven in defiance of God's command. They deny God's existence and His rightful place as the sovereign center of life; they sought to reach heaven through their own inventions, efforts, and methods. They replaced faith in God with faith in self, society and idols. But Almighty God overruled their plans to accomplish His plans. He confused their language, forcing these ancient peoples to fulfill His command to scatter and fill the earth.
