# The Perpetual Battle With Sin – Genesis 20 

Like in Genesis 12, Abraham again involved Sarah in a lie and declared she was his sister, he defaulted to a familiar human solution that had not worked before. In this chapter, Abimelek took Sarah to be his wife. And once again, God acted and warned Abimelek. God acknowledged Abimelek's clear conscience and clean hands, and He intervened to protect all involved. Abimelek, a pagan king, showed remarkable reverence and prompt obedience as he responded to God. He informed his officials and summoned Abraham for questioning. Abraham confessed the fear that captured his heart and stole his discernment. God faithfully protected Sarah and Abraham despite Abraham's unfaithfulness. God is infinitely stronger than human failure.

# The Promised Son Is Born – Genesis 21:1-7 

Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. Abraham circumcised him when he was eight days old. When we wait on God, He brings what He determines is best, in His perfect timing. Not every prayer brings our desired outcome, but God promises His presence and sufficiency at every point in our journey. Even when our deepest longings go unmet and our prayers seem unanswered, He is faithful. God can be trusted.

# The Painful Separation From Ishmael – Genesis 21:8-21 

After Isaac was born, there is some conflict between Sarah and Isaac, and Hagar and Ishmael. Sarah demanded to get rid of them. Abraham was distress and God responsed and directed Abraham to listen to Sarah. God relieved Abraham's distress and confirmed His care for Ishmael and Hagar.

After Ishmael and Hagar have been sent off, they are in the desert with no water. She left Ishmael under a bush and went away and cried. God spoke about and reminded of his promise to Ishmael, becoming a great nation. God provided a well to meet their physical needs. 

# The Peaceful Solution to Strife – Genesis 21:22-34 

Abimelek recognized that God's presence was with Abraham, and he and his army commander, Phicol, approached Abraham, seeking a formal promise that he would treat them with kindness. Abraham valued peace as he lived in a community with Abimelek's people. Believers should pursue peace in this world as long as that peace does not involve compromise with God and His Word.

In gratitude and worship, Abraham planted a tamarisk tree and called on the name of the LORD, "the Eternal God."
