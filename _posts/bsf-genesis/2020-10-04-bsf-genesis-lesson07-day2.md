# Summary of Genesis 9:18-23

The bible recorded for us that Noah has three sons, and they were the beginning of filling the whole earth with people. 

Here, we see that Noah, despite personally experienced God and has been faithful to obey God, isn't without sin. He fell into sin in drunkenness. His son, Ham, saw his father naked and drunk but did not cover Noah. Instead, he went to tell his brothers. The brothers did something more honorable, walking backward so that they would not see their father naked; they covered Noah.
