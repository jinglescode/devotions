Are you not much more valuable than they?`. `33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. 34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.`. There is only so much I can do; there is only this much I can plan. I will try my best, and God will take care of the rest.
