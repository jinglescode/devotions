# Summary of Genesis 27:30-41

As soon as Jacob left Isaac, Esau came to Issac with the meal. Then, he realized that he had just blessed Jacob. Isaac accepted God's will and confessed God's blessing to Jacob would stand – "indeed he will be blessed." Esau cried and asked for blessings, but Issac can't do anything. He cannot revoke the blessings he gave Jacob. In the end, Esau intends to kill Jacob.

All things work for our good
Though sometimes we don't see
How they could
Struggles that break our hearts in two
Sometimes blind us to the truth
Our Father knows what's best for us
His ways are not our own
So when your pathway grows dim
And you just don't see Him,
Remember you're never alone
God is too wise to be mistaken
God is too good to be unkind
So when you don't understand
When don't see His plan
When you can't trace His hand
Trust His Heart
Trust His Heart
He sees the master plan
And he holds our future in His hand,
So don't live as those who have no hope,
All our hope is found in Him
We see the present clearly
But He sees the first and the last
And like a tapestry He's weaving you and me,
To someday be just like Him
God is too wise to be mistaken
God is too good to be unkind
So when you don't understand
When don't see His plan
When you can't trace His hand
Trust His Heart
He alone is faithful and true
He alone knows what is best for you
God is too wise to be mistaken
God is too good to be unkind
So when you don't understand
When don't see His plan
When you can't trace His hand
Trust His Heart
When you don't understand
When you don't see His plan
When you can't trace His hand
Trust His Heart
Trust His Heart
