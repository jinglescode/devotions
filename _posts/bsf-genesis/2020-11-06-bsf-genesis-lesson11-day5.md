# Summary of Genesis 18:1-15

The Lord appeared to Abraham, and Abraham looked up and saw three men. Abraham bowed and provided hospitality. Served fine bread, tender calf, curds and milk. Then the Lord spoke about Sarah will give birth to a son; Sarah heard and laughed as she has doubts. God pointed her out, and she has to grow her faith to believe what God says will come true. 

# Questions

**How might Abraham and Sarah's hospitality have differed in verses 1-8 if they were not sincerely grateful to serve?** Abraham would not have rush and bowed before them. They would not have served the finest food.

**What differences do you experience when you "have to" serve instead of when you "get to" serve?** Have to serve will make it seems like a duty, as a job, a task to do. But get to serve is a privilege, where we will put our heart while doing the task.

**How do the visitors' actions in verses 9-15 show the purpose for their arrival?** As they mentioned about Sarah will have a son next year, it was done so that Sarah can hear it. Her disbelief and begin pointed out by them can help her learn a lesson. Also, since she was told before Isaac was born, when Isaac was born, that will surely grow her faith. 

**After she had laughed, how did Sarah know it was the Lord who had spoken?** Because Sarah laughed to herself as she thought of those doubts in her mind. But the Lord pointed it out to Abraham about what Sarah was thinking. Mere humans cannot read people's minds.

**What did Sarah have to believe? How is this the same for every believer today?** `Is anything too hard for the Lord?` Nothing is impossible for God. When God promises something, it will be fulfilled.
