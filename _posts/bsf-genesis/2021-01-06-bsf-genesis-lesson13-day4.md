# Summary of Genesis 19:30-38

Abraham acted as he trusted for God to protect and provide Hagar and Ishmael, he gave them food and water and sent them away. As the water ran out, Hagar left Ishmael under a bush and left him in a distance as she can't witness him dying. God heard and came to Hagar, and provided the water for them. God provided their physical need and (again) promise to make Ishmael into a great nation.

# Questions

**How did God care for Hagar and Ishmael?** When their water ran out, God heard their cry and provided them with a well of water in the Desert of Beersheba.

**How do God's responses to Hagar and Ishmael help you think differently about God's grace?** God knows our troubles, and God's grace is given for everyone.

**How is God's concern to bless Ishmael for Abraham's sake reflected in your attitudes, actions or prayers regarding Abraham's descendants today?** God's mercy and love are not limited to a specific group of people; his compassion and love have kept Hagar and Ishmael alive. Despite what every relationship problems there can have between 2 sons of different backgrounds, despite whatever hate-filled relations between different nations, God loves, seeks, and cares for all these people.
