# Summary of Genesis 3:14-19

In the beginning, the serpent didn't. have to crawl on its belly and didn’t have to eat dust every day. Sin changes the way we walk, rather than walking uprightly, we crawl around. Sin changes the way we move through life.

Verse 15 is a prophetic verse that speaks of Jesus' victory, that Jesus defeated Satan.

Childbearing was not supposed to be painful. Sin causes pain, pain of all kinds. Pain of regret, pain of shame.

It is easy that we often listen to our wives and people around us, rather than listening to God. Adam's work in the perfect garden was supposed to be "very good". But sin caused toil, and Adam had to earn his living, even have to deal with troubles in life, to Adam, thorns and thistles.

> For the wages of sin is death… - Romans 6:23

Humans will return to dust. But even before their physical death, we experienced spiritual death the moment they sinned against God. Sin also causes the death of relationships — the death of a marriage, the death of a family relationship.

> For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. 22 For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. - 1 Corinthians 15:21-22
